About PySB
----------

*PySB* is an open source tool developed in the laboratory of
Peter K. Sorger at Harvard Medical School
by C. F. Lopez, J. L. Muhlich, and J. A. Bachman.  *PySB* was
motivated by the desire to create a mathematical representation of a
"biological word model" in a manner that does not result in
significant loss of information. Our approach aimed to embed a
rules-based language formalism within a fully developed programming
language. We wanted the language to be simple, flexible, extensible,
and easy to learn. After much work, the idea to develop *PySB* in the
*Python* programming language began to mature. At the time of release
*PySB* consists of a set of core algorithms that allow the user to
develop programs, similar to the way a user thinks about biology,
using *Python* at a biological rules-language level. *PySB* also
provides a set of biochemical macros to enable model creation and
offers a novel paradigm in biological model building in a modular
manner. *PySB*, through in-house developed code or through available
*Python* modules, has the capablities to develop models of any
arbitrary size, numerical integration using ODEs, numerical model
analysis, computer experiment plotting, model visualization, symbolic
math manipulations, and provides a base for users to develop
interactions with any tools available in the *Python* programming
language.


About the Developers
--------------------

*Carlos F. Lopez* received his B.A. and B.S. from University of Miami,
Ph. D. from University of Pennsylvania and trained as a postdoctoral
fellow with Peter J. Rossky at University of Texas at Austin and Peter
K Sorger at Harvard Medical School. He is now an assistant professor
at Vanderbilt University, department of Cancer Biology where he
continues to contribute to PySB.

*Jeremy L. Muhlich* received his B.S. from Johns Hopkins University
and is a Staff member in the laboratory of Professor
Peter K. Sorger. He is an active developer of PySB. 

*John A. Bachman* received his B.S. from Harvard University and is
working toward his Ph. D. at Harvard Medical School. He continues to
contribute and use PySB for his work. 

*Peter K. Sorger* received his A.B. from Harvard College, Ph.D. from
 Trinity College Cambridge, U.K. and trained as a postdoctoral fellow
 with Harold Varmus and Andrew Murray at the University of California,
 San Francisco. Sorger is the Otto Krayer Professor of Systems
 Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and co-founder of the
 Open Microscopy Environment (OME), MITâ€™s Computational and Systems
 Biology Initiative (CSBi), the Council for Systems Biology in Boston
 (CSB2; www.csb2.org) and companies that include Merrimack
 Pharmaceuticals and Glencoe Software and serves on the scientific
 advisory and corporate boards of several other technology
 companies. He is director of the Center for Cell Decision Processes,
 an NIH Center of Excellence in Systems Biology and co-directs a new
 HMS program in Systems Pharmacology.
